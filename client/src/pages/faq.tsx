      a: "ILA Green's interventions support environmental sustainability objectives aligned with Schedule VII of the Companies Act, subject to how the client integrates outcomes into their broader CSR strategy. Final applicability rests with the client's CSR committee and auditors."
    },
    {
      q: "Can your reports be used in ESG disclosures or annual reports?",
      a: "Yes. Our reports are structured to support internal ESG reporting, sustainability disclosures, and stakeholder communication. All data is supported by on-ground measurement and vendor documentation."
    },
    {
      q: "How is the data collected and verified?",
      a: "Data is collected through on-site audits, waste segregation, and weight-based measurement. It is cross-verified with vendor processing confirmations and internal validation checks."
    },
    {
      q: "Will this disrupt our daily operations?",
      a: "No. Audits and segregation are planned to minimise disruption. Engagements are designed to integrate with existing workflows wherever possible."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you handle e-waste?",
      a: "No. ILA Green does not handle e-waste or e-waste reporting."
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a pilot engagement last?",
      a: "Pilot engagements are typically short-term and scope-defined. Timelines are agreed upfront based on site size and waste profile."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you guarantee zero landfill waste?",
      a: "No. We work towards maximum landfill diversion that is practically achievable for each site. All outcomes are reported transparently."
    },
    {
      q: "What about pricing and commercials?",
      a: "Commercials are defined based on site size, waste profile, duration, and reporting requirements. Pilot engagements are offered at a reduced scope-based commercial model."
